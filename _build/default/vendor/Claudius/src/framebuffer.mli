(** Provides the simulated framebuffer for Claudius.

The framebuffer is logically an array of memory in which you draw using palette entries, similar to say how VGA worked on old PCs. *)

type t

(** {1 Initializations} *)

val init: int * int -> (int -> int -> int) -> t
(** [init width height f] Creates a new framebuffer of the specified size [width] x [height] and
    initialises each pixel using the provided function. The function is provided the x and y
    coordinates of the pixel and should return the colour there. *)



(** {1 Drawing operations}
    These operations let you modify the framebuffer with basic shapes. This list isn't exhaustive,
    but just some basics to let people get up and running. Shapes will be automatically clipped to fit
    the framebuffer. Position (0, 0) is in the top left of the screen. *)

(** {2 Functional style }
  In functional style, you should aim to build up a transformation pipeline where you effectively have a series of steps like so:

  + Generate data
  + Advance data by time step t
  + Transform data to list of rendering Primitive.t elements
  + Pass list to Frambuffer.render
*)


val render: t -> Primitives.t list -> unit
(** [render framebuffer primitives] Takes a list of primative shapes and calls the appropriate
    drawing operation for each in turn to render them into the provide framebuffer. *)


(** {2 Imperative style }
  As an alternative to the functional style above, you can just draw directly to the framebuffer in an imperative style, one operation at a time.
*)

val draw_line: int -> int -> int -> int -> int -> t -> unit
(** [draw_line x0 y0 x1 y1 colour framebuffer] Draws a line between ([x0], [y0]) ([x1], [y1]) specified in
    the specified [colour] into [framebuffer]. *)

val draw_circle: int -> int -> float -> int -> t -> unit
(** [draw_circle x0 y0 radius colour framebuffer] Draws the outline of a circle centred at ([x0], [y0]) with the specified [radius]
    in the specified [colour] into [framebuffer]. *)

val filled_circle: int -> int -> float -> int -> t -> unit
(** [filled_circle x0 y0 radius colour framebuffer] Draws a filled circle centred at ([x0], [y0]) with the specified [radius]
    in the specified [colour] into [framebuffer]. *)

val draw_rect: int -> int -> int -> int -> int -> t -> unit
(** [draw_rect x y width height colour framebuffer] Draws the outline of a rectangle aligned with the window, with the top left at ([x], [y]) and size of ([width], [height])
    in the specified [colour] into [framebuffer]. *)

val filled_rect: int -> int -> int -> int -> int -> t -> unit
(** [filled_rect x y width height colour framebuffer] Draws a filled rectangle aligned with the window, with the top left at ([x], [y]) and size of ([width], [height])
    in the specified [colour] into [framebuffer]. *)

val draw_triangle: int -> int -> int -> int -> int -> int -> int -> t -> unit
(** [draw_triangle x0 y0 x1 y1 x2 y2 colour framebuffer] Draws the outline of a triangle made from the points ([x0], [y0]), ([x1], [y1]), and ([x2], [y2])
    in the specified [colour] into [framebuffer]. *)

val filled_triangle: int -> int -> int -> int -> int -> int -> int -> t -> unit
(** [filled_triangle x0 y0 x1 y1 x2 y2 colour framebuffer] Draws a filled triangle made from the points ([x0], [y0]), ([x1], [y1]), and ([x2], [y2])
    in the specified [colour] into [framebuffer]. *)

val draw_polygon: (int * int) list -> int -> t -> unit
(** [draw_polygon points colour framebuffer] Draws the outline of a polygon made from the list of [points]
    in the specified [colour] into [framebuffer]. *)

val filled_polygon: (int * int) list -> int -> t -> unit
(** [filled_polygon points colour framebuffer] Draws a filled polygon made from the list of [points]
    in the specified [colour] into [framebuffer]. *)

val draw_char: int -> int -> Font.t -> char -> int -> t -> int
(** [draw_char x y font c colour framebuffer] Draws a single character [c] in the specified [colour] using [font]. The top left of
    the charcter is the point specified by position ([x], [y]). The return value is the number of pixels wide the character was. *)

val draw_string: int -> int -> Font.t -> string -> int -> t -> int
(** [draw_string x y font s colour framebuffer] Draws the string [s] in the specified [colour] using [font]. The top left of
    the first charcter is the point specified by position ([x], [y]). The return value is the number of pixels wide the string was. *)


(** {1 Pixel operations}
  Rather than working with shape primatives, sometimes you want to work with pixels directly, for example creating plasma effects
  or drawing fractals, etc. Again, Claudius has both a functional approach for this and an imperative approach.
*)

(** {2 Functional style}
  In the functional style you can pass functions that will be called per pixel on the source, doing a full transform of the framebuffer to a
  new state. Some common tricks that emerge from this are examples like clearing the screen:

  {[
  Framebuffer.map_inplace (fun _ -> 0) existing_framebuffer;
  ]}

  Or to fade out the previous frame (assuming you have a palette where lower values are darker):

  {[
  Framebuffer.map_inplace (fun x -> match pixel with 0 -> 0 | x -> x - 1) existing_framebuffer;
  ]}

  All of these functions have a inplace and non_implace version: the non-implace version makes for more functional code, but
  if you do it a lot the memory allocations will slow things down, and in which case you may wish to consider using inplace versions.
*)

type shader_func = int -> int
(** You pass [shader_func value] to the map functions, which call it passing in a single pixel value from which to derive a new pixel value. *)

type shaderi_func = int -> int -> t -> int
(** You pass [shaderi_func] to the mapi functions, which passes in both the current x y coordinates and the existing framebuffer from which you
can then extract values for generating the updated value. *)

val map: shader_func -> t -> t
(** [map f framebuffer] Generates a new framebuffer of the same dimensions by applying the provided
    function [f] to each pixel value in the original to generate a new pixel in the target. *)

val mapi: shaderi_func -> t -> t
(** [mapi f framebuffer] Generates a new framebuffer of the same dimensions by applying the provided
    function [f] to each pixel value and its coordinates in the original to generate a new pixel in the target. *)

val map_inplace: shader_func -> t -> unit
(** [map_inplace f framebuffer] Updates a framebuffer by applying the provided
    function [f] to each pixel value to update its value. *)

val mapi_inplace: shaderi_func -> t -> unit
(** [mapi_inplace f framebuffer] Updates a framebuffer by applying the provided
    function [f] to each pixel value and its coordinate value to update its value. *)

val map2: (int -> int -> int) -> t -> t -> t
(** [map2 f first second] Takes two framebuffers of equal size and applys the function [f] to each pixel
    pair in turn to generate a new framebuffer. *)

val map2_inplace: (int -> int -> int) -> t -> t -> unit
(** [map2_inplace f first second] Takes two framebuffers of equal size and applys the function [f] to each pixel
    pair in storing the result back in the first provided framebuffer. *)



(** {2 Imperative style}
  Sometimes you don't want to transform the entire framebuffer, and so you can do per pixel calls also.
*)

val pixel_write: int -> int -> int -> t -> unit
(** [pixel_write x y colour framebuffer] Set the pixel at the specified coordinate to palette colour
    in the provided framebuffer. If the coordinate is outside the framebuffer then nothing is drawn, but
    there is no error. *)

val pixel_read: int -> int -> t -> int option
(** [pixel_read x y framebuffer] Get the pixel colour at the specified coordinate in the
    provided framebuffer. If the coordinate is outside the framebuffer you get None,
    otherwise Some colour. *)


(** {1 Misc} *)

val to_array: t -> int array array
(** [to_array framebuffer] converts the framebuffer into a 2D array. The top level array is an array
    of rows, and each row is an array of palette entry colours. *)
